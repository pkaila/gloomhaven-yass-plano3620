Gloomhaven Y.A.S.S. for Plano 3620
----------------------------------

This repository contains insets for 4 [Plano Prolatch Stowaway Horizontal 3600 (Plano 3620)](https://www.planomolding.com/fishing/stowaway-utility-boxes/prolatch/prolatch-stowaway-horizontal-3600) boxes for storing tokens and cards required for playing [Gloomhaven](http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven). It was inspired by the Gloomhaven Y.A.S.S. by Ryan H on the [BoardGameGeek Forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1726878/yss-yet-another-storage-solution).

How to use:

1. Download the official [Gloomhaven Creator Pack V2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A3Budnzy2L225DvVQY9_9z2HvvXb3Bio/view)
2. Create a symbolic link named `Creator Pack V2` into the repository root directory and point it to the extracted Creator Pack
3. Install the `Creator Pack V2/Font/PirataOne-Gloomhaven.ttf` -font
4. Open the HTML file(s) in a browser and print

**NOTE:** I have only tested these pages on Firefox. You might need to reduce print margins to zero in the browser to be able to print the insets correctly.

**NOTE:** The Status Tokens inset is still missing some icons as they were not readily available.
